# Tic-Tac-Toe-Ai
For my final project in the ICS4U course, I have created an advanced Tic Tac Toe Ai in Java which my teacher has said was one of the most amazing final projects she had ever seen. Using methods of recursion I created an Ai that can play Tic Tac Toe in various difficulties, the hardest one being impossible to defeat.  This program consists of -Starting menu -Options to play against human or computer (one or two-player modes) -Options to choose which player goes first -Difficulties to choose between -Scoreboard -Prompts to indicate if the user won or lost  this project uses the concepts of an advanced algorithm called minimax which determines every possible outcome of the game and chooses its move accordingly.  Difficulties (for Ai) Easy- Randomly chooses any unselected spot on the board, can be easily outmaneuvered. Medium- Utilizes minimax function but not to the fullest extent can be outmaneuvered sometimes. Impossible- Utilizes the minimax algorithm to the fullest extent, cannot be outmaneuvered.  Next Steps This project was created in a very limited timeframe and although I was very happy with how it turned out there is always room for improvement. These are a few things I would have liked to add -Music/ Sound effects -Alpha-beta pruning for the minimax algorithm  Hope this helps
